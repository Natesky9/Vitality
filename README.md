This plugin creates heal hitsplats whenever your heath is positively changed, similar to how the Soulreaper axe does. This works with Sanguinesti staff, blood spells, guthans, blood fury, and even food! Combo eats even work! As it only uses the visible hitpoints stat, it will not work for other players, monsters or pvp so it does not break any rules
